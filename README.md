# MalayalamBooks

Translate Technical books available in GNU Free Documentation License to Malayalam Language


Python Language provides Natural Language Processing toolkit (Refer http://www.nltk.org), to convert text to many languages including Indian languages.

For creating large number of Malayalam books, first use the machine power to  translate the document to Malayalam and then correct the document with the help of language experts

I have translated GIMP Book using machine power. Output is provided in ODT, PDF and PO files. ODT format can be converted to your favorite format such as DOC, DOCX etc. using LibreOffice 

Use Google Noto Malayalam Fonts for the best result (Italic and ItalicBold are derived from regular and bold)
